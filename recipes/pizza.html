    <h4>Neapolitan Pizza Margherita</h4>
    <p>
      Neapolitan pizza is a round pizza with a raised, crispy and slightly
      charred edge. Topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella and one, or a
      couple of well-balanced toppings. But the two things that make Neapolitan
      pizza stand out are the flavor and consistency of the crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many variations of Neapolitan pizza dough, but this is the
      traditional: direct dough fermented at room temperature. And all you need
      is <strong>4 ingredients</strong>: flour, water, salt, and yeast.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>922g <strong>Tipo 00 flour</strong> (100%)</li>
      <li>553ml <strong>cool water</strong> (60%)</li>
      <li>23g of <strong>fine sea salt</strong> (3%)</li>
      <li>
        1g of <strong>fresh yeast</strong> (0.1%) or 0.28g of
        <strong>active dry yeast</strong> (0.03%)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Add water to a mixing bowl and dissolve the salt</strong>.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add 10% of the flour while mixing</strong> with your hands or a
        wooden spoon.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        When you have a smooth, batter-like consistency
        <strong>add the yeast and dissolve it</strong> (you don’t want the yeast
        to be in direct contact with salt, as this may damage it).<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gradually add the rest of the flour while mixing</strong>, until
        you end up with one, single mass.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Move the dough out of the mixing bowl to the countertop, and start
          kneading</strong
        >. Knead the dough by hand for 15-20 minutes, or in a stand mixer at low
        speed for 10-15 minutes, until you get a pretty smooth dough. The goal
        is to develop gluten and incorporate air into the dough.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leave the dough&nbsp;covered to rest for 15-30 minutes</strong
        >.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Fold the dough over itself a few times and form a smooth, round
          dough</strong
        >.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Place the dough in an airtight container</strong>, or in a bowl
        covered in plastic wrap, and
        <strong>let it rise for around 14 hours</strong>.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        After 14 hours,
        <strong
          >take out the dough, and cut it into dough balls of 250 grams
          each</strong
        >. Make sure the dough balls are smooth and even to get round, nice
        pizzas.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Place the dough balls in a lightly floured proofing box and let them
          rise for another 10 hour</strong
        >. If you don’t have a pizza proofing box, you can place the dough balls
        individual bowls with lid or covered in plastic wrap instead.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Preparing and baking the pizza</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat your oven.</strong> If you use a wood-fired pizza oven,
        preheat it until the floor of the oven is around 850°F (430°C) and the
        ceiling is around 900°F (480°C). You can check the temperature using an
        infrared thermometer. If you use a home oven, place a pizza stone or
        steel in the oven and preheat on the hottest setting for at least 1
        hour.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Take out one dough ball from the rising box</strong> using a
        dough using pizza spatula or dough scraper. Sprinkle some flour around
        the edge of the dough ball and use the spatula to loosen all the sides
        (if it’s stuck to other dough balls or and edge), then get it under the
        ball and lift it right out.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Place the dough ball in a small pile of flour and press it gently
          from the center using the palm of your hands</strong
        >. Make sure to leave 1/2 inch (1cm) around the edge of the dough to
        form the crust (cornicione). Then stretch it into a 10-11 inch (25-27cm)
        round disc.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Get rid of any excess flour from the dough and place it on a clean
          part of your countertop</strong
        >.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add 60-80g of Neapolitan pizza sauce</strong> in the center of
        the disc, and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon using circular
        motion.<br />
      </li>
      <li><strong>Add cheese and other toppings</strong>.<br /></li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Slide the pizza onto your pizza peel and quickly transfer it into the
          oven</strong
        >. You want to work quickly to prevent the pizza from sticking to the
        countertop or the peel.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the pizza for 60-90 seconds in a pizza oven</strong>, and
        make sure to turn it to get an even bake. <br /><strong
          >In a home oven, bake the pizza for for 4-8 minutes on a pizza stone
          or steel</strong
        >, depending on how hot your oven is. And if you have a grill function
        or broiler, turn it on during baking for an even hotter bake. That’s
        going to get you pretty close to the heat of a pizza oven!<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Using the pizza peel, remove the pizza from the oven, transfer it to
          a serving plate and serve immediately.</strong
        >
        Neapolitan pizza should be eaten right from the oven!
